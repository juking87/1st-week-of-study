<p style="margin-top:40px">
    I am planning to save at least 5,000,000Won by end of 2022. In order to achieve it, I will have to save 50% of my income. But right now it is nearly impossible. So I will have to work on holidays to fullfill my goals. Working at Jpaper on saturday is one of the options which I think this is the easiest way to do. Second option, which I prefer to do, is doing side job on the weekends with the knowledge that I will have to learn as soon as possible.
